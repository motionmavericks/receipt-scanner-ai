# Performance Optimization Command

Analyze and optimize code performance:
1. Profile current performance bottlenecks
2. Identify inefficient algorithms or data structures
3. Look for unnecessary re-renders (React/Vue/Angular)
4. Check for memory leaks
5. Optimize database queries if applicable
6. Implement caching where appropriate
7. Consider lazy loading for large datasets
8. Review bundle size and implement code splitting if needed

Focus areas:
- Time complexity improvements
- Space complexity optimization
- Network request optimization
- Rendering performance
- Build size reduction
